# MOBILE FLASHCARDS

This project was built with expo snack. The application was tested in an iPhone XS using the expo app. I had trouble setting up my local environment and as the instruction said I am able to develop in a snack.

I have used KeyboardAvoidingView o avoid overlapping with the keyboard and input. Also, I have used TouchableWithoutFeedback to dismiss the keyboard if you touch it in another area. So to test input text on the web You must click holding it inside the input area.
